-- ExoRT radiation schemes --

n68equiv
  -- As of September 2020, this is the recommended version to use for all terrestrial planet cases
  -- Correlated-k coefficients produced with HELIOS-K (Grimm et al. 2015)
  -- H2O, HITRAN 2016, Voigt lineshape, 25 cm-1 cutoff, plinth remove
  -- H2O Self and Foreign Continuum from MT_CKDv3.3 fit to gauss pts
  -- CO2, HITRAN 2016, Perrin and Hartmann (1989) subLorentzian lineshape, 500 cm-1 cutoff, with CO2-CO2 CIA
  -- CH4, HITRAN 2016, Voigt lineshape, 25 cm-1 cutoff
  -- N2-N2, N2-H2, H2-H2 CIA downloaded from HITRAN
  -- CO2-H2, CO2-CH4 CIA from Turbet et al. (2020)
  -- 68 spectral intervals, 8 gauss points
  -- gas overlap using equivalent extinction absorption method (Amundsen et al. 2016)
  -- Pressures from 10 bars to 0.01 mb
  -- Temperatures from 100 K to 500 K

n84equiv
  -- Same as n68equiv, except bins added shortward of 0.24 microns.
  -- Use this for F stars (6500 K < T < ~10000 K)

n28archean
  -- H2O, CO2, CH4, N2, H2, HITRAN 2004, 28 bins, designed for the Archean Climate (formerly 'highco2')
  -- H2O and CO2 continuum from MT_CKD2.5 (see Halevy et al. 2009)
  -- mixed gas k-distributions created using LBLRTM (Mlawer et  al. 1997, Shi et al. 2009)
  -- CO2 up multi bars, reasonable agreement for 2 bar dry CO2
  -- CH4 up to 0.01 bar. NOTE: older line list misses CH4 near-IR absorptio
  -- H2O overesimates absorption in the near-IR around M-dwarfs due to coarse bands
  -- refer to Wolf, E.T. and Toon, O.B. Astrobiology 13(7), 1-18 (2013)
  -- up to 100 bar total pressures
  -- N2-N2, N2-H2, H2-H2 CIA

n42h2o
  -- H2O, N2, H2 42 bins, HITRAN 2012 | n42 was the winner
  -- H2O singe gas k-distributions created with Helios-K (Grimm et al. 2015)
  -- refer to Kopparapu et al. ApJ 845:5 (2017)
  -- up to 10 bar total pressures
  -- N2-N2, N2-H2, H2-H2 CIA

n28h2o
  -- same as n42h2o, 28 bins

n35h2o
  -- same as n42h2o, 35 bins

n68h2o
  -- same as n42h2o, 68 bins

n42h2o_16gpt
  -- same as n42h2o, 16 gauss points per spectral interval

n42h2o_32gpt
  -- same as n42h2o, 32 gauss points per spectral interval

n68h2o_16gpt
  -- same as n68h2o, 16 gauss points per spectral interval
